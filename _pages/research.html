My research centres on philosophical questions surrounding the biological and cultural evolution of complex social-dynamical systems using formal tools from evolutionary game theory.

My primary research programme focuses upon the evolution of language as a social phenomenon.

In Lewis&apos; (1969) conception of a signalling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (2010) offers a dynamic explanation of how signalling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. I extend the atomic signalling game to include a variable parameter which allows for &apos;degrees&apos; of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms&apos; and Lewis&apos; respective models.

         We examine how power might influence the cultural evolution of inequitable norms between discernible groups (such as gender or racial groups) in a population of otherwise identical individuals.
