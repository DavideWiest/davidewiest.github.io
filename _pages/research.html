      <p>
         My dissertation argues that what drives the emergence of complex communication systems is a process of modular composition, whereby independent communicative dispositions combine to create more complex dispositions. This challenges the dominant view on the evolution of language, which attempts to resolve the explanatory gap between communication and language by demonstrating how complex syntax evolved. My research shows that these accounts fail to maintain sensitivity to empirical data: genuinely compositional syntax is extremely rare or non-existent in nature. In contrast, my research prioritises the reflexivity of natural language—the ability to use language to talk about language—as an alternative explanatory target.

         The first part of my dissertation provides the philosophical foundation of this novel account using the theoretical framework of Lewis-Skyrms signalling games and drawing upon relevant work in evolutionary biology, linguistics, cognitive systems, and machine learning. Chapter 1 introduces the signalling game and contextualises it with respect to problems in the realm of traditional philosophy of language. Chapter 2 examines empirical data from biology and linguistics and argues that complex syntax is not the most apt explanatory target for how language might have evolved out of simple communication. Chapter 3 then argues that the reflexivity of language is a more fruitful property to consider, showing how reflexivity aids the evolution of complex communication via a process of modular composition. This connects parallel research in the evolution of language, cognitive systems, and machine learning paradigms. Once such complexity is exhibited, at a small scale, it may lead to a 'feedback loop' between communication and cognition that gives rise to the complexity we see in natural language.
      </p>
         The second part of my dissertation provides a set of models, along with analytic and simulation results, that show precisely how (and under what circumstances) this process of modular composition is supposed to work.

   <summary><a> <strong> Power by Association </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         We use tools from evolutionary game theory to examine how power might influence the cultural evolution of inequitable norms between discernible groups (such as gender or racial groups) in a population of otherwise identical individuals. Similar extant models always assume that power is homogeneous across a social group. As such, these models fail to capture situations where individuals who are not themselves disempowered nonetheless end up disadvantaged in bargaining scenarios by dint of their social group membership. Thus, we assume that there is heterogeneity in the groups in that some individuals are more powerful than others.
      </p>
      <p>
         Our model shows that even when most individuals in two discernible sub-groups are relevantly identical, powerful individuals can affect the social outcomes for their entire group; this results in power by association for their in-group and a bargaining disadvantage for their out-group. In addition, we observe scenarios like those described where individuals who are more powerful will get less in a bargaining scenario because a convention has emerged disadvantaging their social group.

   <summary><a> <strong> Evolutionary Explanations of Simple Communication: Signalling Games &amp; Their Models </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>         
         This paper applies the theoretical criteria laid out by D'arms et al. (1998) to various aspects of evolutionary models of signalling. The question that D'Arms et al. seek to answer can be formulated as follows: Are the models that we use to explain the phenomena in question conceptually adequate? The conceptual adequacy question relates the formal aspects of the model to those aspects of the natural world that the model is supposed to capture. Moreover, this paper extends the analysis of D'Arms et al. by asking the following additional question: Are the models that we use sufficient to explain the phenomena in question? The sufficiency question ask what formal resources are minimally required in order for the model to get the right results most of the time.

   <summary><a> <strong> On Salience and Signalling in Sender-Receiver Games: Partial-Pooling, Learning, and Focal Points </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         I introduce an extension of the Lewis-Skyrms signaling game, analysed from a dynamical perspective via simple reinforcement learning. In Lewis' (Convention, Blackwell, Oxford, 1969) conception of a signaling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (Signals: evolution, learning & information, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010a) offers a dynamic explanation of how signaling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signaling game examined here—which I refer to as a <i>salience game</i>—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signaling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms' and Lewis' models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is amplified, to the benefit of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly. <br>
