<p>My research centres on philosophical questions surrounding the biological and cultural evolution of complex social-dynamical systems using formal tools from evolutionary game theory. My primary research programme focuses upon the evolution of language and draws upon relevant work in evolutionary biology, linguistics, cognitive systems, and machine learning.</p>

<p>My second research programme concerns (non-linguistic) social phenomena more generally. This research stems from work that was done under an NSF grant on <i>Social Dynamics and Diversity in Epistemic Communities</i> (PI: Cailin O'Connor) at UC Irvine. I use formal models and simulations to make arguments about a variety of social phenomena. For example, my research on discrimination shows how small degrees of power give rise to radically inequitable distributions of resources between perceptibly distinct, but otherwise effectively identical, populations of individuals. This result has consequences for the viability of accounts of distributive justice. My research in social epistemology shows how false beliefs spread and persist in a network of individuals, even when an explicit retraction has been issued.</p>

<p>Outside of this main field of study, I have additionally conducted research in philosophy of language (more traditionally construed) and metasemantics; 20th Century analytic philosophy—especially Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein; and philosophy of machine learning—including AI safety.</p>

   <summary><a> <strong> Complex Signals: Reflexivity, Hierarchical Structure, and Modular Composition </strong></a></summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         My dissertation argues that what drives the emergence of complex communication systems is a process of modular composition, whereby independent communicative dispositions combine to create more complex dispositions. This challenges the dominant view on the evolution of language, which attempts to resolve the explanatory gap between communication and language by demonstrating how complex syntax evolved. My research shows that these accounts fail to maintain sensitivity to empirical data: genuinely compositional syntax is extremely rare or non-existent in nature. In contrast, my research prioritises the reflexivity of natural language—the ability to use language to talk about language—as an alternative explanatory target. 
      </p>
      <p>
         The first part of my dissertation provides the philosophical foundation of this novel account using the theoretical framework of Lewis-Skyrms signalling games and drawing upon relevant work in evolutionary biology, linguistics, cognitive systems, and machine learning. Chapter 1 introduces the signalling game and contextualises it with respect to problems in the realm of traditional philosophy of language. Chapter 2 examines empirical data from biology and linguistics and argues that complex syntax is not the most apt explanatory target for how language might have evolved out of simple communication. Chapter 3 then argues that the reflexivity of language is a more fruitful property to consider, showing how reflexivity aids the evolution of complex communication via a process of modular composition. This connects parallel research in the evolution of language, cognitive systems, and machine learning paradigms. Once such complexity is exhibited, at a small scale, it may lead to a 'feedback loop' between communication and cognition that gives rise to the complexity we see in natural language.
      </p>
         The second part of my dissertation provides a set of models, along with analytic and simulation results, that show precisely how (and under what circumstances) this process of modular composition is supposed to work.

         This paper applies the theoretical criteria laid out by D'arms et al. (1998) to various aspects of evolutionary models of signalling. The question that D'Arms et al. seek to answer can be formulated as follows: Are the models that we use to explain the phenomena in question conceptually adequate? The conceptual adequacy question relates the formal aspects of the model to those aspects of the natural world that the model is supposed to capture. Moreover, this paper extends the analysis of D'Arms et al. by asking the following additional question: Are the models that we use sufficient to explain the phenomena in question? The sufficiency question ask what formal resources are minimally required in order for the model to get the right results most of the time.

   <summary><a> <strong> On Salience and Signalling in Sender-Receiver Games: Partial-Pooling, Learning, and Focal Points </strong> <br> <p style="text-indent: 20pt"><i>Synthese</i><p></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         I introduce an extension of the Lewis-Skyrms signaling game, analysed from a dynamical perspective via simple reinforcement learning. In Lewis' (Convention, Blackwell, Oxford, 1969) conception of a signaling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (Signals: evolution, learning & information, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010a) offers a dynamic explanation of how signaling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signaling game examined here—which I refer to as a <i>salience game</i>—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signaling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms' and Lewis' models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is amplified, to the benefit of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly. <br>

   <summary><a> <strong> Accounting for Polysemy and Role Asymmetry in the Evolution of Compositional Signals </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         Several formal models of signalling conventions have been proposed to explain how and under what circumstances compositional signalling might evolve. I suggest that these models fail to give a plausible account of the evolution of compositionality because (1) they apparently take <i>linguistic</i> compositionality as their target phenomenon, and (2) they are insensitive to role asymmetries inherent to the signalling game. I further suggest that, rather than asking how signals might come to be compositional, we must clarify what it would mean for signals to <i>be</i> compositional to begin with.

   <summary><a> <strong> The Correction Game or, How Pre-Evolved Communicative Dispositions Might Affect Communicative Dispositions </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         How might pre-evolved communicative dispositions affect how individuals learn to communicate in a novel context? I present a model of learning that varies the reward for coordination in the signalling game framework under simple reinforcement learning as a function of the agents' actions. The model takes advantage of a type of modular compositional communicative bootstrapping by which the sender and receiver use pre-evolved communicative dispositions—a "yes/no" command—to evolve new dispositions.

   <summary><a> <strong> Power by Association </strong> (with Cailin O'Connor) </a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         We use tools from evolutionary game theory to examine how power might influence the cultural evolution of inequitable norms between discernible groups (such as gender or racial groups) in a population of otherwise identical individuals. Similar extant models always assume that power is homogeneous across a social group. As such, these models fail to capture situations where individuals who are not themselves disempowered nonetheless end up disadvantaged in bargaining scenarios by dint of their social group membership. Thus, we assume that there is heterogeneity in the groups in that some individuals are more powerful than others.
      </p>
      <p>
         Our model shows that even when most individuals in two discernible sub-groups are relevantly identical, powerful individuals can affect the social outcomes for their entire group; this results in power by association for their in-group and a bargaining disadvantage for their out-group. In addition, we observe scenarios like those described where individuals who are more powerful will get less in a bargaining scenario because a convention has emerged disadvantaging their social group.

   <summary><a> <strong> Epistemology and the Structure of Language </strong> (with Jeffrey A. Barrett) </a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         We are concerned here with how structural properties of language may evolve to reflect features of the world in which it evolves. As a concrete example, we will consider how a simple term language might evolve to support the principle of indifference over state descriptions in that language. The point is not that one is justified in applying the principle of indifference to state descriptions in natural language. Rather, it is that one should expect a language that has evolved in the context of facilitating successful action to reflect probabilistic features of the world in which it evolved.

   <summary><a> <strong> Using Logic to Evolve More Logic: Composing Logical Operators via Self-Assembly </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         I consider how complex logical operations might self-assemble in a signalling-game context via composition of simpler underlying dispositions. On the one hand, agents may take advantage of pre-evolved dispositions; on the other hand, they may co-evolve dispositions as they simultaneously learn to combine them to display more complex behaviour. In either case, the evolution of complex logical operations can be more efficient that evolving such capacities from scratch. Showing how complex phenomena like these might evolve provides an additional path to the possibility of evolving more or less rich notions of compositionality. This helps provide another facet of the evolutionary story of how sufficiently rich, human-level cognitive or linguistic capacities may arise from simpler precursors.

   <summary><a> <strong> What Russell Can Denote: Aboutness and Denotation Between <i>Principles</i> and 'On Denoting' </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         How ought we to analyse propositions that are about nonexistent entities? Russell (1903) details the concept of <i>denoting</i> in <i>Principles of Mathematics</i>, and this theory appears to answer the question posed. However, in the paper 'On Denoting' (Russell 1905), we see that his theory of denoting has changed greatly. Hylton (1990) argues that the move from the former theory to the latter was unnecessary. The purpose of this paper is to show that, contra Hylton, the move to the theory found in 'On Denoting' was indeed necessary.</p>
         <p>I argue that Hylton is correct to the extent that an answer to our first question relies on a different question concerning the ontology of nonexistent entities. However, this fails to take into account is a more interesting question regarding the truth values of propositions containing such puzzling entities. This question relies on Russell's notion of aboutness, and in this sense is more sensitive to his theory as a complete picture of denotation. If we take the aboutness relation seriously, then we see that the move from the former theory to the latter was necessary after all.<br>
