<p>
  My foremost objectives as an instructor are (<i>i</i>) to enable students to see the bearing and applicability of philosophy to their everydaylives and (<i>ii</i>) to foster students' confidence in their ability to succeed at philosophy while (<i>iii</i>) helping to improve their abilities to read, write, speak,and think clearly and critically about philosophical ideas. To achieve these  objectives, I use a goal-based approach that focuses on maximising student motivation via environment, expectancy, and value.
