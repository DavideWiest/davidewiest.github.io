             There is an analogy between machine learning systems and economic entities in that they are both adaptive, and their behaviour is specified in a more or less explicit way. It appears that the area of AI that is most analogous to the behaviour of economic entities is that of <i>morally good decision-making</i>, but it is an open question as to how precisely moral behaviour can be achieved in an AI system. This paper explores the analogy between these two complex systems, and we suggest that a clearer understanding of this apparent analogy may help us forward in both the socio-economic domain and the AI domain: known results in economics may help inform feasible solutions in AI safety, but also known results in AI may inform economic policy. If this claim is correct, then the recent successes of deep learning for AI suggest that more <i>implicit</i> specifications work better than explicit ones for solving such problems.

   <summary><a> <strong> Using Logic to Evolve More Logic: Composing Logical Operators via Self-Assembly </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         In recent work on self-assembly, Barrett and Skyrms (2017) show how a binary logical operator can evolve more quickly in a signalling game when the agents utilize pre-evolved dispositions-as opposed to learning a new disposition from scratch-via template transfer. Their argument is not intended to show how such logical dispositions might evolve in the first place. Further, template transfer does not show how to evolve, e.g., a ternary-input logical operator from a binary-input logical operator. This paper extends their analysis. I begin by analysing simple unary logical operations, rather than binary ones. I then show how binary logical operations can evolve out of unary logical operations via modular composition-a process whereby one game evolves to accept the play of another game as input. Thus, the new models presented here are able to account for phenomena which cannot be accommodated by the models presented in Barrett and Skyrms (2017).

   <summary><a> <strong> The Correction Game </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         How might pre-evolved communicative dispositions affect how individuals learn to communicate in a novel context? I present a model of learning that varies the reward for coordination in the signalling-game framework under simple reinforcement learning as a function of the agents' actions. The model takes advantage of a type of modular compositional communicative bootstrapping by which the sender and receiver use pre-evolved communicative dispositions—a "yes/no" command—to evolve new dispositions.

   <summary><a> <strong> Less Is More: Degrees of Compositionality for Complex Signals </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         Several formal models of signalling conventions have been proposed to explain how and under what circumstances compositional signalling might evolve. I suggest that these models fail to give a plausible account of the evolution of compositionality because (1) they apparently take <i>linguistic</i> compositionality as their target phenomenon, and (2) they are insensitive to role asymmetries inherent to the signalling game. I further suggest that, rather than asking how signals might come to be compositional, we must clarify what it would mean for signals to be compositional to begin with.

   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         I examine Simchen's (2017) challenge to interpretationist metasemantics by extending his theoretical problem of singular reference in light of actual communicative exchanges. I show that when the problem is couched in these terms, the ability to refer depends inherently upon coordination—the onus of which is on the receiver. Thus, I show how the interpretationist stance, in this case, can reasonably be understood to encompass the productivist stance.

   <summary><a> <strong> On the Role of Power in the Evolution of Inequitable Norms </strong></a> </summary>
      <p>
         (w/ Cailin O'Connor)
      </p>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         We use tools from evolutionary game theory to examine how power might influence the cultural evolution of inequitable norms between discernible groups (such as gender or racial groups) in a population of otherwise identical individuals. Similar extant models always assume that power is homogeneous across a social group. As such, these models fail to capture situations where individuals who are not themselves disempowered nonetheless end up disadvantaged in bargaining scenarios by dint of their social group membership. Thus, we assume that there is heterogeneity in the groups in that some individuals are more powerful than others.
      </p>
      <p>                                     
         Our model shows that even when most individuals in two discernible sub-groups are relevantly identical, powerful individuals can affect the social outcomes for their entire group; this results in power by association for their in-group and a bargaining disadvantage for their out-group. In addition, we observe scenarios like those described where individuals who are more powerful will get less in a bargaining scenario because a convention has emerged disadvantaging their social group.

   <summary><a> <strong> On The Role of Information in the Evolution of Signalling </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
          I present new analytic and numerical analyses of signalling games that give rise to informational bottlenecks—that is to say, signalling games with more state/act pairs than available signals to communicate information about the world. I show that agents learning to coordinate tend to favour maximal information transfer in spite of the fact that nothing from an initial analysis of the stability properties of the underlying signalling game suggests that this should be the case. To explain this, I note that the underlying structure of this model favours maximal information transfer in regard to the simple combinatorial properties of the ways in which the agents might partition nature into kinds.

   <summary><a> <strong> On Salience and Signalling in Sender-Receiver Games </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
      I introduce an extension of the Lewis-Skyrms signalling game, analysed from a dynamical perspective via simple reinforcement learning. In Lewis' (1969) conception of a signalling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (2010) offers a dynamic explanation of how signalling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signalling game examined here—which I refer to as a <i>salience game</i>—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signalling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms' and Lewis' models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is amplified, to the benefit of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly.

      <div class="indented">
         <p>         
            I apply the theoretical criteria laid out by D'Arms, et al. (1998) to various aspects of evolutionary models of signalling (Skyrms 2010). The question that D'Arms, et al. seek to answer can be formulated as follows: Are the models that we use to explain the phenomena in question conceptually adequate? The conceptual adequacy question relates the formal aspects of the model to those aspects of the natural world that are supposed to be captured by the model. Moreover, this paper extends the analysis of D'Arms, et al. by asking the following additional question: Are the models that we use sufficient to explain the phenomena in question? The sufficiency question asks what formal resources are minimally required in order for the model to get the right results most of the time.

   <summary><a> <strong> Fractionally Quantified Predicate Logic </strong></a> </summary>
      <div class="indented">
         <p>
            The notion of fractional quantification—quantified statements of the form 'at least half of A are B'—arises in the context of Aristotle’s Syllogistic. Several different models have been proposed to formalize syllogistic logic—the most complete of which, perhaps, in which the syllogistic is extended to include denumerably many quantifiers (Johnson 1994). However, the notion of fractional quantification seems to arise only in the context of Aristotle’s syllogistic. The question that is raised here is simply, '<i>Why</i>?' 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           In order to answer this question, the purpose of this paper is to adequately formulate the motivation for the question of whether it is possible to construct a (non-Aristotelian) formal system supplemented with fractional quantification. This will be assesed in two sections: first, antecedent problems with classical quantification that would make such a model desirable; second, (forseeable) initial problems that may arise as a consequence of such a construction, to the extent that it is possible.
