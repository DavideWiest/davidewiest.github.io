   <summary><a> <strong> Using Logic to Evolve More Logic: Composing Logical Operators via Self-Assembly </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         In recent work on self-assembly, Barrett and Skyrms (2017) show how a binary logical operator can evolve more quickly in a signaling game when the agents utilize pre-evolved dispositions-as opposed to learning a new disposition from scratch-via template transfer. Their argument is not intended to show how such logical dispositions might evolve in the first place. Further, template transfer does not show how to evolve, e.g., a ternary-input logical operator from a binary-input logical operator. This paper extends their analysis. I begin by analysing simple unary logical operations, rather than binary ones. I then show how binary logical operations can evolve out of unary logical oper- ations via modular composition-a process whereby one game evolves to accept the play of another game as input. Thus, the new models presented here are able to account for phenomena which cannot be accommodated by the models presented in Barrett and Skyrms (2017).

   <summary><a> <strong> Less Is More: Degrees of Compositionality for Complex Signals </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         Several formal models of signalling conventions have been proposed to explain how and under what circumstances compositional signalling might evolve. I suggest that these models fail to give a plausible account of the evolution of compositionality because (1) they apparently take _linguistic_ compositionality as their target phenomenon, and (2) they are insensitive to role asymmetries inherent to the signalling game. I further suggest that, rather than asking how signals might come to be compositional, we must clarify what it would mean for signals to be compositional to begin with.

   <summary><a> <strong> Reference by Proxy and Truth-in-a-Model </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         I examine Simchen's (2017) challenge to interpretationist metasemantics by extending his theoretical problem of singular reference in light of actual communicative exchanges. I show that when the problem is couched in these terms, the ability to refer depends inherently upon coordination---the onus of which is on the receiver. Thus, I show how the interpretationist stance, in this case, can reasonably be understood to encompass the productivist stance.

   <summary><a> <strong> On the Role of Power in the Evolution of Inequitable Norms </strong></a> </summary>
      <p>
         (w/ Cailin O'Connor)
      </p>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
         We use tools from evolutionary game theory to examine how power might influence the cultural evolution of inequitable norms between discernible groups (such as gender or racial groups) in a population of otherwise identical individuals. Similar extant models always assume that power is homogeneous across a social group. As such, these models fail to capture situations where individuals who are not themselves disempowered nonetheless end up disadvantaged in bargaining scenarios by dint of their social group membership. Thus, we assume that there is heterogeneity in the groups in that some individuals are more powerful than others.
      </p>
      <p>                                     
         Our model shows that even when most individuals in two discernible sub-groups are relevantly identical, powerful individuals can affect the social outcomes for their entire group; this results in power by association for their in-group and a bargaining disadvantage for their out-group. In addition, we observe scenarios like those described where individuals who are more powerful will get less in a bargaining scenario because a convention has emerged disadvantaging their social group.

   <summary><a> <strong> On Salience and Signalling in Sender-Receiver Games </strong></a> </summary>
   <div class="indented">
      <p>
      I introduce an extension of the Lewis-Skyrms signaling game, analysed from a dynamical perspective via simple reinforcement learning. In Lewis' (1969) conception of a signaling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (2010) offers a dynamic explanation of how signaling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signaling game examined here—which I refer to as a <i>salience game</i>—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signaling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms' and Lewis' models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is amplified, to the benefit of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly.

   <summary><a> <strong> Signaling Games &amp; Their Models </strong></a> </summary>
      <div class="indented">
         <p>         
            I apply the theoretical criteria laid out by D'Arms, et al. (1998) to various aspects of evolutionary models of signalling (Skyrms 2010). The question that D'Arms, et al. seek to answer can be formulated as follows: Are the models that we use to explain the phenomena in question conceptually adequate? The conceptual adequacy question relates the formal aspects of the model to those aspects of the natural world that are supposed to be captured by the model. Moreover, this paper extends the analysis of D'Arms, et al. by asking the following additional question: Are the models that we use sufficient to explain the phenomena in question? The sufficiency question asks what formal resources are minimally required in order for the model to get the right results most of the time.
