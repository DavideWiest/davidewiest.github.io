## Endeavors and Interests 

- Studying computer science at TU Darmstadt starting Winter Semester 2025
- Open to qualitative work experiences, research or projects
- Working towards a career path in Machine Learning, most probably research-oriented
- Aspiring to understnd machine learning on both a theoretical and intuitive level
- Experimenting with new approaches and in possibly underexplored spaces
- Currently: Experimenting with local learning and alternatives to backpropagation (e.g. hebbian learning or versions of the forward-forward algorithm)

## Previous Projects

- [Clac3](https://github.com/DavideWiest/Clac3) programming language backend
- [Leto](https://leto.axym.org/), a modern speed reader
- [PV electricity capacity forecast](/files/PV_Analyse_Facharbeit.pdf)

## About Me

- Night-Owl
- Big fan of Synthwave, Phonk, long walks and brilliant ideas that change the very field the game is being played on
- [Anti-Essentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-essentialism), [Naturalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)), [Structuralist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)) (see also [Bundle Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_theory))
- On the one hand, I want to get things done and be maximally pragmatic. On the other hand, I want to experiment and do creative things without clear purpose.
