I am a philosopher of language, science, and biology whose work is very much informed by evolutionary game theory.

I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). I am also a visiting researcher at Mila—the [Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/ "Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute")—associated with [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/ "Université de Montréal"), supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio").

I previously received an M.A. in Social Science from the [Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.imbs.uci.edu/ "Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences") at UC Irvine, as well as an M.A. in Philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University") and a B.A. in Philosophy (Hons.) and English Literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").

My primary research interests concern the biological and cultural evolution of complex social-dynamical phenomena in general—specifically the evolution of linguistic phenomena, including communication, meaning, and compositionality. My work draws upon evolutionary biology, linguistics, cognitive systems, and machine learning.
