<p> I'm a Ph.D candidate in the department of <a href="https://www.lps.uci.edu">Logic and Philosophy of Science</a> at the <a href="https://uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a>, supervised by <a href="http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/">Jeffrey A. Barrett</a>. I am currently a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms (Mila)</a> associated with <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a>, supervised by <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ ">Yoshua Bengio</a>.</p>

<p> I previously received an MA in philosophy from <a href='https://sfu.ca/'>Simon Fraser University</a>, and a BA in philosophy (hons.) and English literature from the <a href='https://ubc.ca/'>University of British Columbia</a>. </p>

<p> My research interests concern the evolution of social dynamical phenomena in general, and specifically the evolution of linguistic phenomena. </p>
