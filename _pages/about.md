I am a philosopher of language, science, and biology whose work is very much informed by evolutionary game theory. I am primarily interested in artificial intelligence and language origins.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Mila - Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/ "Mila") and the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/ "DIRO - UdeM") ([Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca "UdeM")), where I study ethically aligned artificial intelligence. I am supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio") (Mila, UdeM, CIFAR) and [Dominic Martin](https://sites.google.com/view/dmartin/ai-ethics?authuser=0 "Dominic Martin") (UQàM).

I also hold a half-time appointment in the [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca "UofT Philosophy") and the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://www.torontosri.ca "Toronto SRI") ([University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca "UofT")), where I study social cognition under [Jennifer Nagel](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/jennifer-nagel/ "Jennifer Nagel"). 

I received my PhD (2020) from the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), where I was supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). My dissertation, "Complex Signals: Reflexivity, Hierarchical Structure, and Modular Composition", discusses a novel process by which language might have evolved via modular composition of communicative structures. My committee was composed of Jeffrey A. Barrett (Chair), Brian Skyrms, Simon M. Huttegger, and Cailin O'Connor.

I previously received an MA in Social Science from the [Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.imbs.uci.edu/ "Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences") at UC Irvine, as well as an MA in Philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University") and a BA in Philosophy (Hons.) and English Literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").
