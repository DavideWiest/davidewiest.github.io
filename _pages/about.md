I'm a Ph.D candidate in the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). I am currently a visiting researcher at the [Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/ "Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms") associated with [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/ "Université de Montréal"), supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio").

I previously received an MA in Social Science from the [Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.imbs.uci.edu/ "Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences") at UC Irvine, as well as an MA in Philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University") and a BA in Philosophy (hons.) and English Literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").

My primary research interests concern the evolution of social-dynamical phenomena in general—specifically the evolution of linguistic phenomena, including communication, meaning, and compositionality.
