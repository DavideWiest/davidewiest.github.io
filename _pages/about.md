I am a philosopher of language, science, and biology whose work is very much informed by evolutionary game theory.

I am currently a visiting researcher at Mila—the [Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/ "Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute")—supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio"). 

I will receive my PhD from the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), where I was supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). My dissertation, titled "Complex Signals: Reflexivity, Hierarchical Structure, and Modular Composition" discusses a novel process by which language might have evolved via modular composition of communicative structures. It was successfully defended on 02 March 2020. My committee was composed of Jeffrey A. Barrett (Chair), Brian Skyrms, Simon M. Huttegger, and Cailin O'Connor.

I previously received an M.A. in Social Science from the [Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.imbs.uci.edu/ "Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences") at UC Irvine, as well as an M.A. in Philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University") and a B.A. in Philosophy (Hons.) and English Literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").

My primary research interests concern the biological and cultural evolution of complex social-dynamical phenomena in general—specifically the evolution of linguistic phenomena, including communication, meaning, and compositionality. My work draws upon evolutionary biology, linguistics, cognitive systems, and machine learning.

My Erd&#246;s number is 4, along the following path:
