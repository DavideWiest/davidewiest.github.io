I'm a Ph.D candidate in the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). I am currently a visiting researcher at the [Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/ "Montréal Institute for Learning Algorithms") associated with [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/ "Université de Montréal"), supervised by [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio").

I previously received an MA in philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University"), and a BA in philosophy (hons.) and English literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").

My primary research interests concern the evolution of social dynamical phenomena in general, and specifically the evolution of linguistic phenomena.
