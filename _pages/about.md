I am currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Philosophy](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/arts/philosophy.html "Dal Philo") at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/ "Dal"). I teach in the philosophy department and the Faculty of Computer Science. 

Previously, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at [Mila - Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/ "Mila") and the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/ "DIRO - UdeM") ([Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca "UdeM")), where I studied ethically aligned artificial intelligence with [Yoshua Bengio](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/ "Yoshua Bengio") (Mila, UdeM, CIFAR) and [Dominic Martin](https://sites.google.com/view/dmartin/ai-ethics?authuser=0 "Dominic Martin") (UQàM).

I was also a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Philosophy](https://philosophy.utoronto.ca "UofT Philosophy") and the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://www.torontosri.ca "Toronto SRI") ([University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca "UofT")), where I examined problems surrounding the legal and social regulation of artificial intelligence, as well as fundamental questions on the ethical and philosophical implications of AI and emerging technologies.

I received my PhD (2020) from the department of [Logic and Philosophy of Science](https://www.lps.uci.edu "Logic and Philosophy of Science") at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu "University of California, Irvine"), where I was supervised by [Jeffrey A. Barrett](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jeffreybarrett/ "Jeffrey A. Barrett"). My dissertation, ["Complex Signals: Reflexivity, Hierarchical Structure, and Modular Composition"](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5328x080 "Complex Signals"), discusses a novel process by which language might have evolved via modular composition of communicative structures. My committee was composed of Jeffrey A. Barrett (Chair), Brian Skyrms, Simon M. Huttegger, and Cailin O'Connor.

I previously received an MA in Social Science from the [Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.imbs.uci.edu/ "Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences") at UC Irvine, as well as an MA in Philosophy from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/ "Simon Fraser University") and a BA in Philosophy (Hons.) and English Literature from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia").
