## Abstract

In Lewis' (1969) conception of a signalling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (2010) offers a dynamic explanation of how signalling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. I extend the atomic signalling game to include a variable parameter which allows for 'degrees' of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms' and Lewis' respective models.
