## Details
It provides abstractions for individual modules to work together through dependency injection. With it, you can create more complex prompt chains/pipelines as it simplifies prompt templating and prompt chaining, among other things, through a project-wide fluent interface. The entire project also includes asynchronous counterparts and is tested with 55 NUnit tests. Furthermore, attention was given to developing with a cyclomatic complexity (<6 for methods), class coupling (<10 for methods), and a Maintainability Index of 82. You can find the documentation <a href="https://github.com/DavideWiest/ContextFlow/wiki" target="blank">here</a>.
