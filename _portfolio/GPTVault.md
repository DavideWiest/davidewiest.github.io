## Details
What you are seeing is a conceptual graph generated from GPTVault. GPTVault is a proof-of-concept tool that uses generative models to accumulate knowledge in a way that makes it usable. It works by querying a large language model (LLM) about a starting topic. The LLM will respond with a brief description of the concept, a list of related concepts, and a list of subconcepts. This information is then saved in a knowledge base, which can be explored and visualized in a variety of ways. GPTVault can be used for a variety of purposes, including concept exploration, personal knowledge management, and content creation. It is a tool that can help you to learn more about or organize a concept.
