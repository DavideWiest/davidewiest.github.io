## Details
Used a series of mutlivariate time series models from the package Darts to forecast the electricity generated from PV-systems in Germany using 8 historic and 1 predicted metrics. Optimizing mode architecture (N-Beats), evaluating and using the forecast in a research-paper about the consequences of the national growth in pv-systems.
