## Details
This project explored predicting football match goals using machine learning. The goal was to test a goal-count-based regression model against the default choice of a win/loss/draw classification model. Despite achieving some success in predicting match outcomes, limitations in goal margin prediction prevented real-world profitability. The model was tested by simulating betting as monte-carlo-simulations and visualizing it's accuracy compared to simpler betting paradigms.
